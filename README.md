# AI Cloud Platform Referee

## Problem
Beginners often struggle to choose between AWS, Azure, and GCP because most resources give one recommendation instead of explaining trade-offs.

## Solution
This project acts as a referee. It compares cloud platforms based on user needs and explains the pros, cons, and trade-offs so users can make their own decision.

## Features
- Simple comparison
- Clear pros and cons
- Trade-off explanation
- Beginner-friendly interface

## Tech Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Kiro for ideation and explanation

## How Kiro Helped
Kiro helped me structure comparisons, simplify explanations, and reduce confusion while building the project.
