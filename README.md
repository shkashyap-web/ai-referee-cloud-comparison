# AI Cloud Platform Referee

## Problem
Beginners often struggle to choose between AWS, Azure, and GCP because most resources give a single recommendation instead of explaining trade-offs.

## Solution
This project acts as a referee. Instead of giving one answer, it compares cloud platforms based on user needs and explains pros, cons, and trade-offs so users can make informed decisions.

## What This Tool Does
- Compares AWS, Azure, and GCP
- Explains strengths and weaknesses of each option
- Highlights trade-offs instead of declaring a “winner”
- Helps beginners choose based on their own constraints

## How Kiro Helped
Kiro was used to:
- Explore comparison logic
- Generate structured pros and cons
- Simplify explanations for beginners
- Accelerate understanding before writing any code

All prompts, iterations, and screenshots are documented inside the `.kiro` directory.
